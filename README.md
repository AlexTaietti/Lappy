## Lappy

Lappy is a simple piece of JS that can track multiple HTML elements on your page and check if they are overlapping (due to scrolling or drag) and to trigger callbacks on various stages of the overlap.

## Demos
Here's a [concept demo](https://codepen.io/AlexTaietti/full/rNxEZpY) and here's [something](https://codepen.io/AlexTaietti/full/eYZmVay) a little more useful instead.

You can also see these demos live in your browser by cloning this repo and running `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` and visiting your "localhost" on port 3000 from your browser

Any suggestions and tips about this project (or anything really) are greatly appreciated!
